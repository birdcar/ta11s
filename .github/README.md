# Ta11s

An Eleventy starter site configured with Tailwind, Webpack, Nunjucks, and VS Code goodness.

## Usage

This is a template repository, so to get started is to click the "[Use this template](https://github.com/birdcar/ta11s/generate)" button above and then generate your own copy of this repository for your use.

Alternatively, you could use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to consume the template:

```shell
gh repo create $DESIRED_NAME_OF_REPOSITORY --template birdcar/ta11s
```

Once your copy of the template repository exists, you can clone the repository to your local computer and install the project's dependencies like so:

```shell
npm install
```

If all dependencies install as expected, you'll then be able to run the site locally using `npm start`.

Happy hacking!
