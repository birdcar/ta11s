# Ta11s

An Eleventy starter site configured with Tailwind, Webpack, Nunjucks, and VS Code goodness.

## Usage

This is a template repository, so to get started is to click the "[Use this template](https://github.com/birdcar/ta11s/generate)" button above and then generate your own copy of this repository for your use.

Alternatively, you could use the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) to consume the template:

```shell
gh repo create $DESIRED_NAME_OF_REPOSITORY --template birdcar/ta11s
```

Once your copy of the template repository exists, you can clone the repository to your local computer:

```shell
# Using git
git clone https://github.com/$YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/$NAME_OF_REPOSITORY_YOU_CHOSE_ABOVE

# Or, using the GitHub CLI
gh clone $YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/$NAME_OF_REPOSITORY_YOU_CHOSE_ABOVE
```

Then install the project's dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Finally, you can run the site locally using `npm start` and then opening your web browser to `http://localhost:8081`.
